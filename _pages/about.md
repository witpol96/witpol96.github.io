Welcome to my personal homepage!

I am Ziang Zhang, an undergraduate student at MARS Lab, School of Computer Science, Wuhan University. My research interests focus on computer vision and person re-identification, with a particular emphasis on visual understanding in intelligent surveillance and multimodal perception. I am actively participating in lab projects to gain hands-on research experience and aim to improve the robustness and generalization of models in real-world scenarios.

I look forward to further academic development and welcome opportunities for collaboration and exchange in related research fields.
